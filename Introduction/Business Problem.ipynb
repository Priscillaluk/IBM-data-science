As I really look forward to visting, I decided to use New York City in my project. New York City consists of five boroughs, each of which is a separate county of the State of New York.\n\nAs you can see from the figures, Istanbul is a city with a high population and population density. Being such a crowded city leads the owners of shops and social sharing places in the city where the population is dense. When we think of it by the investor, we expect from them to prefer the districts where there is a lower real estate cost and the type of business they want to install is less intense. If we think of the city residents, they may want to choose the regions where real estate values are lower, too. At the same time, they may want to choose the district according to the social places density. However, it is difficult to obtain information that will guide investors in this direction, nowadays.\n\nWhen we consider all these problems, we can create a map and information chart where the real estate index is placed on Istanbul and each district is clustered according to the venue density.\n",
